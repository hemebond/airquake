This archive contains my air/src/ directory zipped. Some of the files may be unnecessary,
and there's no documentation other than this text file. You may use this code to create
your own non-commercial Quake mods. Most of the code is very badly commented, and the 
latest batch of modifications was pretty much just slapped on top of the other code and
is full of dirty hacks. 

It should compile with FastQCC 1.01, but I don't know about other compilers, or where to
get this particular one. Good luck, and don't say I didn't warn you.
