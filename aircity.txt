Description             : This is the third full map for AirQuake. Its theme
                          is a city, with two bases on opposite sides, a
                          river running through, three bridges over the river,
                          and a subway going under it... Designed for ground
                          vehicles and helicopters only!

                          Now has a single player mission: Penetrate the
                          enemy ground defences and kidnap their leader. :)
                          He's placed in the base opposite side of the city.
                          Drive to him and stop your engines to pick him up.
                          Then return to your HQ. The enemies have both air
                          and ground forces on your way, and it is not an
                          easy mission. (I don't do it every time with the
                          humvee :)

Additional Credits to   : ID and who ever created Quest
                          But some discredits to the author of Quest
                          for making it incompatible to my video card
                          without univbe. (The 1.091 worked fine!!)
