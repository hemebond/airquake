This is the AirQuake texture wad by Iikka Ker„nen, 1997.
Updated 10/7/1997 (2nd release)

You may only use these textures in AirQuake levels, and only if you release
the levels as freeware or they are included in official AirQuake package.
Most of the textures included are my sole property, and some are modified
from works of ID software. You may only distribute this wad on non-commercial
media (Internet and BBS's).

Currently in:
- All textures used in Aircity.bsp; brick walls, asphalt, sky, water, rock.
- All textures used in other levels too. (ship textures & some metals added)
