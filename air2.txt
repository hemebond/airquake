Description             : This is the second full map for AirQuake. It
                          contains two outdoor areas with air bases, and
                          a cave system between them.

                          Your single player mission:
                          Enemies are attacking by air and ground forces,
                          you are to prevent destruction of your HQ. After
                          you have taken out the attackers, you are to
                          launch a counterattack and destroy the enemy base,
                          and all their military units. It's pretty hard. :)

                          for making it incompatible with my video card
                          without univbe. (The 1.091 worked fine!!)
